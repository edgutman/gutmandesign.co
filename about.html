                        <p class="body-text">I started my career convinced that beautiful design was enough. After watching countless pixel-perfect prototypes fail to move the needle, I learned that the best design solves real business problems.</p>
                        
                        <p class="body-text">This shift in perspective led me to fintech, where every design decision has measurable impact. At Affirm, I improved loan repayment rates by 1%+ through thoughtful notification design. At Quantcast, I reduced client onboarding time by 85% with a complete UX overhaul.</p>
                        
                        <p class="body-text">Today, I help consumer and fintech companies design products that drive results. My approach combines user research, growth experimentation, and business strategy to create experiences that both users and stakeholders love.</p>
