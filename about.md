## From Rockets to Pixels: An Unlikely Journey

Most product designers didn't start by calculating rocket trajectories, but then again, most designers haven't learned to think in complex systems the way aerospace engineers do. My path from aerospace engineering at Cal Poly to product design evolved through curiosity, a love for solving complex problems, and the realization that the same systems thinking that works for spacecraft works beautifully for digital products. What I discovered: The skills that help you design a satellite's trajectory—breaking down complex systems, understanding how small changes create massive impacts—translate remarkably well to designing fintech products that handle millions of dollars in transactions.

## How I Work & What I'm Up To

I bring an engineer's mindset to design challenges, combining rigorous research with data-driven decisions and systems thinking that helps teams scale. My approach focuses on measurable impact—like the notification system that improved Affirm's repayment rates by 1%+ or leading Altruist's first comprehensive client research study. I'm based in Los Angeles but work with teams everywhere, currently available for consulting projects with fintech and consumer companies looking to improve their products and grow their design teams. When I'm not designing, you'll find me outdoors hiking with my dog, who gives excellent (and honest) design feedback.
